# Project2
this is a single view application. 

This application is a simple quiz.  The user imputs his or her name in the provided text field, and then it will ask them if they are a dog or cat person.  Three questions will be asked below and the user will turn on which switch describes them best.  After they hit submit, a image view of a dog or cat will show up saying whether the user is a dog or cat person.
